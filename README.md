# RegEx File Hider

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows hiding files and folders matching a specific regex from the file explorer.

## How to Use
### Setting the RegEx
- Open Obsidian's settings
- Go to the `RegEx File Hider` tab
- Click on `Manage`
- Set your new RegEx

### Showing Hidden Files/Folders
You can toggle the visibility status of the files and folders by running the
`RegEx File Hider: Toggle Visibility` command.

### Ribbon Icon
If you want an icon in the ribbon sidebar, I would recommend using
[Customizable Sidebar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-customizable-sidebar)
and adding the `RegEx File Hider: Toggle Visibility` command.
